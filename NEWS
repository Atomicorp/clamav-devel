0.98.5
------

Welcome to ClamAV 0.98.5! ClamAV 0.98.5 includes important new features
for collecting and analyzing file properties. Software developers and
analysts may collect file properties using the ClamAV API and then
analyze them with ClamAV bytecode programs. Using the new features will
require that libjson-c is installed, but otherwise libjson-c will be
optional.

Look for our upcoming series of blog posts to learn more about using the
ClamAV API and bytecode facilities for collecting and analyzing file
properties.

ClamAV 0.98.5 also includes these new features:

    - Support for the XDP file format and extracting, decoding, and
      scanning PDF files within XDP files.
    - Addition of shared library support for LLVM verions 3.1 - 3.4
      for the purpose of just-in-time(JIT) compilation of ClamAV
      bytecode signatures. Andreas Cadhalpun submitted the patch
      implementing this support.
    - Enhancements to the clambc command line utility to assist
      ClamAV bytecode signature authors by providing introspection
      into compiled bytecode programs.
    - Resolution of many of the warning messages from ClamAV compilation.
    - Bug fixes and other feature enhancements. See Changelog or
      git log for details.
